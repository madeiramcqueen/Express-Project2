### About the App, All In One Place:
 All In One Place is an app where educators can compile a list of their subjects and online learning resources for their classes. They are the Admin of the App and can add and/or delete subjects, as well as add, edit, or delete a resource for that subject. As a user, all subjects and learning resources are in one place. Simple to bookmark in their browser, then easily maneuver and navigate through.

1. Improve the styling
2. Have the user rate each resource if they'd like
